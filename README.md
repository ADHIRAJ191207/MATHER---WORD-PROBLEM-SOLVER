# MATHER---WORD-PROBLEM-SOLVER
#Project Description
MATHER is an intelligent, Python-based CLI tool that interprets and solves natural language math word problems involving cost, price, and quantity. It transforms real-world textual math problems into mathematical equations and explains each step in a clear and detailed format. Built using SymPy and Python’s re module, MATHER is ideal for students preparing for competitive exams like SAT, IOQM, or SOF IMO.

#Features:
Understands natural language math problems

Detects numerical patterns and item-cost relationships

Classifies questions by topic (Arithmetic, Algebra, etc.) and difficulty

Solves equations step-by-step using symbolic logic (SymPy)

Command-line interface with live input

Supports currency formats: ₹, Rs., rupees, decimals, and unit phrases like "kg of sugar"

#Compatible with Python 3.13

#Example Questions Supported:
"If 3 pens cost ₹60, what is the cost of 5 pens?"
